# Step 1: Quality Control for ChIP-seq Data
fastqc -o qc_reports/ *.fastq

# Step 2: Read Alignment for ChIP-seq Data
bwa index reference_genome.fa
bwa mem -t 4 reference_genome.fa sample1.fastq sample2.fastq > aligned_reads.sam
samtools view -bS aligned_reads.sam | samtools sort -o aligned_reads.bam
samtools index aligned_reads.bam

# Step 3: Peak Calling for ChIP-seq Data
macs2 callpeak -t aligned_reads.bam -n peaks --outdir peaks/

# Step 4: Quality Control for PLAC-seq Data
# QC for PLAC-seq data if available

# Step 5: Interaction Calling for PLAC-seq Data
# Identify chromatin interactions using PLAC-seq specific algorithms

# Step 6: Annotation and Visualization
# Annotate and visualize the identified interactions
annotatePeaks.pl peaks/peaks.narrowPeak hg38 > annotated_peaks.txt
plotProfile -m aligned_reads.bam -out profile.pdf

# Step 7: Differential Binding Analysis (Optional)
# Perform if comparing between different experimental conditions

# Step 8: Functional Enrichment Analysis
# Perform functional enrichment analysis of interacting regions using external tools

# Step 9: Visualization and Interpretation
# Visualize and interpret the identified chromatin interactions
