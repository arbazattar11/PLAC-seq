# PLAC-seq Data Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to analyze PLAC-seq sequencing data. Below are the steps involved:

1. **Quality Control (QC) for ChIP-seq Data:**
   - FASTQ files for ChIP-seq data are checked for quality using FastQC, and a summary report is generated using MultiQC.

2. **Read Alignment for ChIP-seq Data:**
   - Reads are aligned to the reference genome using BWA, and sorted BAM files are generated using samtools.

3. **Peak Calling for ChIP-seq Data:**
   - Peaks representing protein-DNA interactions are called using MACS2.

4. **Quality Control for PLAC-seq Data:**
   - Perform QC for PLAC-seq data if available.

5. **Interaction Calling for PLAC-seq Data:**
   - Identify chromatin interactions using PLAC-seq specific algorithms.

6. **Annotation and Visualization:**
   - Annotate and visualize the identified interactions using annotatePeaks.pl and plotProfile.

7. **Differential Binding Analysis (Optional):**
   - Perform differential binding analysis if comparing between different experimental conditions.

8. **Functional Enrichment Analysis:**
   - Perform functional enrichment analysis of interacting regions using external tools.

9. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Visualize and interpret the identified chromatin interactions to gain insights into regulatory mechanisms.

## Usage
- Clone this repository.
- Place your ChIP-seq FASTQ files and PLAC-seq data in the same directory as the pipeline script.
- Modify the script as necessary to specify paths and parameters.
- Run the pipeline using `./pipeline.sh`.

## Requirements
- BWA
- Samtools
- MACS2
- FastQC
- MultiQC
- deeptools (for annotatePeaks.pl and plotProfile)

## Notes
- Adjust parameters and additional analysis steps based on specific experimental needs.
- Ensure reference genome files are available and properly indexed.
